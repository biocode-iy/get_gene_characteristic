Preparation step:
You already have fasta file including the group of aa-sequence of genes. Also, the name of species is knownge.


Example gene_of_interest.fasta : 
>MELO3C005013.2
MKKSEEANTASAVVVMGSTQPCAACKILRR........
>MELO3C035136.2
MKEISGRKQGTSLSPC......
>MELO3C012908.2
MTGSGSPCGACKFLR..........

Sp name: Cucumis_melo 
So you can download cds file sequence: Cucumis_melo.Melonv4.cds.all.fa
How to perpare you own cds fasta file:
1- extract Gene_ID from your file:

cat gene of interest.fasta| grep ">" > id.txt

2- get  prepared_cds.fasta by seqkit

seqkit grep -r -f id.txt Cucumis_melo.Melonv4.cds.all.fa -o result.fa

You need: 
1- aa-sequence of genes fasta file
2- prepared cds fasta file
3- gene name shoulf be matched with gene name in cds file.
